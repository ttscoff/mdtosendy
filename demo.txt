# Email Generator Demo

Here's a test email using my own configuration. You can adjust the header image, the signature image, etc. using configuration, and you have complete control over the styling just by editing a CSS stylesheet.

It's easy to add CTAs without extra effort using Apex (https://brettterpstra.com/projects/apex) or Kramdown.

Lists get converted into tables:

- **Here's a cool thing** that's just a regular Markdown list item
- **Here's the other cool thing** that's just another list item

![][floated]Add images by using Markdown syntax and a hosted image URL. You can use MultiMarkdown formatting to right or left align an image. This works well when embedding in a paragraph.

[floated]: https://stuff.brettterpstra.com/446-200x300.jpg style="float:right"

Signature lines are automatically added, you don't need to include a signoff in your Markdown.

Thanks!
